# Movie Recommender System using Unsupervised Learning

## Problem Formulation
1. Given the attributes of the movies, group the similar movies together by using clustering analysis.
2. Given the users rating histories, identify the association rules among the movies to predict what movies the users are going to watch next.

## Dataset
We selected [The Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from Kaggle which consists of 7 CSV files, containing metadata for all 45,000 movies released on or before July 2017 that are listed in the Full MovieLens Dataset, and 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies.

## Machine Learning Techniques
1. K-Means Clustering
2. Apriori Algorithm for association rules mining
